C# stuff

## Tests and Coverage

To run test you could use NUnit project. Sad, but NUnit UI is available only for 2.x.

### Coverage

```bat
.\coverage-calc.bat
.\coverage-report.bat
```

These commands will generate report in the `cover-html` directory.

## No thanks

Seems like I really hate nuget, msvs and its "references"-system.
